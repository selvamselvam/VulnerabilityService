Vulnerability Service
====================
"Vulnerability Service" is Proof of concept for "Webservice based Vulnerability testing framework" Paper. 


Introduction
=============
 Software security is no longer just a problem for software designers, developers and testers. Almost all the white-collar
 crimes are based on computer security. Many research papers are published on static code analysis, dynamic code analysis 
 and software development design time security issues. This paper proposes a framework for testing security vulnerabilities
 based on real time Web service. After analysis and find the vulnerabilities in applications, the security tester uses 
 tools to test the security flow. The security testing framework gets the vulnerability priority from the 
 VulnerabilityTracker webservice. It collects the real time vulnerability attacks from the Common Vulnerabilities database 
 and update test case priority signature in the web service. The Vulnerability Orchestration framework runs the test cases 
 based on VulnerabilityTracker web service as part of the build process and execute security test suites for every build. 
 The security tester adds the new test cases whenever they found new vulnerability.
